# Child Care Check
## *Ensure you find the best care.*

![Image](/static/site-demo.gif)

Reflecting on past experience as a preK teacher, the developer realized that licensing and citation info for CA child care facilities is not especially easy for the public to access and digest. Built off of data from California Dept of Social Services, Child Care Check enables a user to display facilities on a map & filter by adherence to state licensing, location, and center name/key words. Child Care Check is a resource that will help both parents & care providers find quality care environments for children.
